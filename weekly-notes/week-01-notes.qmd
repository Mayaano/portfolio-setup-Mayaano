## Key Concepts Learned
- Introduction to **Public Policy Analytics (MUSA 5080)** and course goals  
- Importance of combining **spatial analysis** with **data science** for urban planning and policy  
- Overview of course deliverables: weekly notes, labs, and final project  
- Initial setup of the **RStudio + Quarto** environment for reproducible workflows  

## Coding Techniques
- Learned how to set the **working directory** in R (`setwd()`)  
- Practiced creating and rendering a **Quarto (.qmd) document**  
- Explored basic Quarto structure: YAML header, markdown formatting, and `render` function  

## Questions & Challenges
- Still clarifying the workflow between **RStudio** and **Quarto rendering** (e.g., where files are stored vs. rendered outputs)  
- Need more practice with GitHub integration for publishing the portfolio  

## Connections to Policy
- Building reproducible workflows with R and Quarto ensures **transparency** and **credibility** in policy-related analysis  
- Portfolio structure mirrors how real-world policy analysts document methods, results, and reflections  

## Reflection
- Most interesting: Seeing how quickly RStudio + Quarto can generate a **professional-looking portfolio website**  
- Plan to apply: Use weekly notes to practice **explaining technical concepts** in plain language, which is critical for communicating with policymakers

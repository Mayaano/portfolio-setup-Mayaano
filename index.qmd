# Welcome to My Portfolio

This portfolio documents my learning journey in **Public Policy Analytics (MUSA 5080)** at the University of Pennsylvania.  
It includes **weekly reflections, lab assignments, and a final project**.

## About This Course
This course introduces advanced spatial analysis and data science for urban planning and public policy.  
Through hands-on labs and projects, I will use tools such as **R, dplyr, tidycensus, and Quarto** to analyze policy-relevant data.  
Key focus: reproducibility, version control, and transparent policy analytics.

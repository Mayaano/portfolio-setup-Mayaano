Hi everyone,

Happy Thursday. Several clarifications:

We don't accept resubmission or re-grading requests for assignments that have already been submitted and graded. All grades are final after posting. Please always double-check your work before submitting, make sure your code is working, and the link is working. (You can submit multiple times before the Deadline.)
As previously announced, you will not get full credit if you don't incorporate the feedback for assignments 4 and 5. You don't need to worry about feedback regarding specific charts or maps. The comprehensive checklist before submitting is attached below. 
The comprehensive list of common offenses is as follows (must be avoided):

Remove extra instruction text in your future homework, such as “Complete the following analysis, documenting each step……”
Make sure you only print stuff in your report for readers. For example, do not print the output from st_read()/st_crs(), nor first rows of a table that's just for your own reference.
Do not display your personal API Key in a public document.
While it's ok to use some help with the code, make sure you do understand your code.
You can make your answers look cleaner by rounding your numbers to 2 digits using the round() function.
Please pay attention to the formatting of your report. Header levels are mistakenly given to text, which makes your contents list on the left very chaotic and hard to navigate.
Please pay more attention to formatting in your answers. Start a new line for each new question/answer.
Use theme_void() to get rid of tick marks on maps.
If you are unsure or have questions, please email your TAs or instructors! See y'all next Monday! Thanks.

Best regards,

Zhanchao

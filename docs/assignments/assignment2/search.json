    "text": "Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.\n\nChallenge Options\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/).\nNote these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis - Data: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) - Question: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?” - Operations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density - Policy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\nOption B: School Safety Zones - Data: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network - Question: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?” - Operations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage - Policy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity - Data: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics) - Question: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?” - Operations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - Policy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment —\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources - Data: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - Question: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?” - Operations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - Policy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies —\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility - Data: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) - Question: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?” - Operations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - Policy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health - Data: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics) - Question: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?” - Operations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators - Policy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage - Data: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings - Question: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?” - Operations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas - Policy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution - Data: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods - Question: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?” - Operations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups - Policy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources: - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics\nIf you have a different idea: Propose your own question! Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load your additional dataset\n\n\nQuestions to answer: - What dataset did you choose and why? - What is the data source and date? - How many features does it contain? - What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\nExamples: - “Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?” - “Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?” - “Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+): - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\nYour Task:\n\n\nCode\n# Your spatial analysis\n\n\nAnalysis requirements: - Clear code comments explaining each step - Appropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At least one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\nYour interpretation:\n[Write your findings here]"

# 1. The Policy Problem {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**What we are predicting:**
We are NOT predicting who or what. We are predicting **WHEN**.

- **Goal:** Determine if eviction rates respond to economic disruptions.
- **Dependent Variable:** `percentage_diff` (Deviation from historical baseline).
- **Context:** Communities vulnerable to immediate budget stress are most affected.

# 2. Why This Matters {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Prevention is cheaper than crisis response

- Legal aid: $5-10k per case
- Homelessness services: $50k+ per family
- Lost tax revenue, community disruption

**Key insight:** Early warning → Early intervention

# 3. Our Solution

A model that uses economic analytics to provide an **Early Warning System**.

- Focuses on identifying periods of heightened risk.
- Allows policymakers to prepare resources *before* the surge hits.

# 4. Data Integration {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Predictors sourced from three datasets:

1.  **Eviction Lab:** `l1_percentage_diff` (Lagged eviction pressure)
2.  **BLS (Macroeconomic):**
    - `unemployment_rate` (Economic shock)
    - `cpi` (Inflation/Cost of living)
3.  **Urban Institute:** Household financial vulnerability indicators (e.g., debt, housing burden)

# 5. Model Specification {.smaller}

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** selected because outcome is continuous and symmetric.

**Dependent Variable:** `percentage_diff`
- Measures how monthly eviction filings deviate from a historical baseline.
- Focus is on modeling *unexpected* increases/decreases.

**Predictors:**
- **Lagged eviction pressure:** `l1_percentage_diff` (Accounts for persistence).
- **Macroeconomic conditions:** `unemployment_rate`, `cpi`.
- **Household financial vulnerability:** Variables distinguishing short-term disruption from structural conditions.

# 6. Results {.smaller}

**Model Performance:**
- **R²: 0.7975** (Explains ~80% of variation)

**Key Findings on Coefficients:**
1.  **Lagged Eviction Pressure:** Positive and highly significant.
    - *Meaning:* Strong persistence; once pressure rises, it tends to continue.
2.  **Unemployment:** Statistically significant negative coefficient.
    - *Meaning:* Consistent with income shock theory regarding deviations from baseline.
3.  **CPI:** Positive but not statistically significant.
    - *Meaning:* Short-run inflation effects are less immediate than labor market shocks.

**Note on Urban Institute Data:**
- Variables were dropped from coefficients due to perfect collinearity (they act as baseline constants), but serve as structural context.

# 7. Validation Strategy {.smaller}

**Comparison of Prediction Errors:**

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Metric Breakdown:**

- **Left: In-Sample** (Jan 2020 - Dec 2022)
  - **MAE:** 0.1225 | **RMSE:** 0.1711
  - *Observation:* Model accurately captures historical month-to-month deviations.

- **Right: Out-of-Sample** (Jan 2023 - Present)
  - **MAE:** 0.1532 | **RMSE:** 0.1833
  - *Observation:* Performance remains stable when forecasting unseen economic conditions.

# 8. Prediction Capabilities {.smaller}

**What the model predicts WELL:**

- **Early Warnings:** Signals upcoming months of high eviction stress 1-3 months in advance, enabling proactive resource deployment. Out-of-sample validation (RMSE = 0.1833) confirms stable performance on unseen economic conditions.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Identifies *when* intensity of resources should be deployed by explaining ~80% of month-to-month variation in eviction filings (R² = 0.7975).

**What the model does NOT predict well:**

- **Spatial Specificity:** Cannot pinpoint specific houses, addresses, or neighborhoods. This is a citywide temporal index, not a localized forecasting tool.
- **Exogenous Policy Shocks:** Cannot forecast unexpected policy decisions (e.g., new moratoriums) that fall outside economic modeling.

# 9. Critical Limitations

**Temporal vs. Spatial:**
- The model successfully predicts citywide temporal fluctuations (time).
- It **does not** capture neighborhood-level variation (space) because the financial vulnerability data is static over the modeled time period.

**Policy Shocks:**
- Cannot predict exogenous policy decisions (e.g., new moratoriums) that are not economic in nature.

# 10. Required Safeguards

**Can't deploy without these:**

1.  **Community Oversight Board** - Tenant orgs, legal aid, Council members (veto power).
2.  **Annual Bias Audits** - Public reporting of model accuracy.
3.  **Prevention-only use** - Never for enforcement.
4.  **Transparency** - Public code, equations, predictions.

# 11. Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Form oversight board, run in shadow mode.

**Phase 2 (Months 4-12):** Public launch, coordinate with legal aid + rental assistance.

**Phase 3 (Year 2+):** Evaluate outcomes, refine.

**Cost-benefit:** High ROI by targeting prevention resources efficiently.

# 12. Recommendation

**Deploy as a Monthly Index**

- Use the predictions as a **Monthly Eviction Pressure Index**.
- **Action:** Update data monthly to monitor changes from month-to-month.
- **Resource Deployment:** Use the index to determine *when* intensity of resources (legal aid, funding) should be scaled up.

**Condition:** Must be paired with the safeguards listed in Slide 10.
